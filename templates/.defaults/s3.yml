# THIS FILE GETS COPIED IN BY THE RDPG-DEV SCRIPT WHEN IT RUNS.
# IF YOU'RE SEEING THIS AT 'templates/s3.yml' as opposed to 
# 'templates/.defaults/s3.yml', you can edit this freely without changes being
# tracked by the git repo. i.e. you can put your creds here safely.

# Change the information in this file to override the default s3 credentials.
# The defaults turn s3 off. Specifically, these should no longer be set to 
# "" if you plan to use s3, instead replaced with the actual values.
